# MLOps Maturity Model
The MLOps Maturity Model describes how an organization can improve its machine learning (ML) processes through five stages, from no automation to full automation. Each level shows how automated and efficient the ML workflow is, moving from basic manual tasks to highly automated systems.

## Level 0: No Automation
- **What's happening?**: At this stage, teams mostly use tools like Jupyter Notebooks to build ML models, but there’s no automation. Every process—like training models or deploying them—is manual.
- **Example**: Imagine a data scientist runs experiments on their laptop but has to manually share results with the team. Every time a model needs to be updated, they have to retrain it by hand.
- **Tools used**: Jupyter Notebooks, no specific automation tools.

## Level 1: Initial Automation (DevOps Principles)
- **What's happening?**: Teams start using some automation, like using DevOps tools to handle code versions and deploy models. But there’s still a lack of automation specific to ML, such as tracking models or experiments.
- **Example**: You might store your model code in GitHub and use Jenkins to deploy it, but you’re still manually tracking model performance and training.
- **Tools used**: GitHub (version control), Jenkins (CI/CD for deployment).

## Level 2: Automated Training
-**What's happening?**: Training models becomes more automated. The training pipelines (the process of preparing data, training models, and saving results) are automated, and you can track experiments easily.
- **Example**: You set up a pipeline where every time new data arrives, the model trains automatically. You can track all the experiments, so you know which model version performed best.
_ **Tools used**: Kubeflow Pipelines (automated training), MLflow (experiment tracking).

## Level 3: Automated Deployment
- **What's happening?**: Deployment is automated, and models are monitored for performance after being deployed. If a model isn’t performing well, you know immediately.
- **Example**: Once a model is ready, it’s automatically deployed into production, and you get alerts if its performance drops. There’s no need to manually intervene.
- **Tools used**: Seldon Core (automated deployment), Prometheus (monitoring).

## Level 4: Full Automation
- **What's happening?**: Everything is automated, including model retraining and deployment. If a model’s performance drops, it automatically retrains and redeploys itself without human intervention.
- **Example**: If a model that predicts customer behavior stops working well because of new trends, it will detect the problem, retrain on new data, and redeploy itself.
- **Tools used**: TFX (TensorFlow Extended for end-to-end ML automation), SageMaker Pipelines (for full automation).

## Key Insights
- 📉 Level 0 - No MLOps: At this stage, ML processes are inefficient and prone to failure. Data scientists work in isolation, which can lead to challenges when handing projects over to engineers. Organizations should aim to move beyond this level for better collaboration and efficiency.
- 🛠️ Level 1 - Initial Automation: Introducing DevOps principles helps streamline some processes, but lacks ML-specific practices. This is a critical first step toward improving model deployment and monitoring.
- 🔧 Level 2 - Automated Training: Implementing automated training pipelines enhances reproducibility and efficiency. This is crucial as multiple models start running in production, warranting a structured approach to manage them.
- 🚀 Level 3 - Automated Deployment: This level emphasizes seamless deployment processes, with model monitoring added for performance evaluation. Organizations are encouraged to adopt this level as they scale their ML applications.
- 🛡️ Level 4 - Full Automation: Represents the pinnacle of MLOps maturity. Automated retraining and deployment based on performance metrics create a robust system, but organizations should ensure the necessity of such automation based on individual project requirements.
- 🧩 Pragmatic Approach: Not all models need to reach the highest maturity level; evaluating the specific needs of each project allows for more efficient resource allocation and risk management in model deployment.
- 🔄 Future Direction: The course aims to equip learners with knowledge of MLOps practices, particularly focusing on levels 2 and 3, to help organizations build more automated and efficient ML systems.

## Tools You Can Use Along the Way:
- Jupyter Notebooks: For basic, manual work at Level 0.
- GitHub/Jenkins: For code versioning and initial automation (Level 1).
- Kubeflow Pipelines, MLflow: For automated training pipelines and experiment tracking (Level 2).
- Seldon Core, Prometheus: For automated deployment and monitoring (Level 3).
- TFX, SageMaker Pipelines: For full automation (Level 4).
